### Developer Tools

[Getting Started with Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)

### Data Project

Get the [IPL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl)

	In this data assignment you will transform raw data from IPL into graphs that will convey some meaning / analysis. For each part of this assignment you will have 2 parts -


	Download both csv files from https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl

	Part 1

	Code a javascript program that will transform the raw csv data into a data structure in a format suitable for plotting with highcharts.

	Generate the following plots ...

	1. Plot the number of matches played per year of all the years in IPL.
	2. Plot a stacked bar chart of matches won of all teams over all the years of IPL.
	3. For the year 2016 plot the extra runs conceded per team.
	4. For the year 2015 plot the top economical bowlers.
	5. Discuss a "Story" you want to tell with the given data. As with part 1, prepare the data structure and plot with highcharts.

	Part 2

	Create a Node Web API with MongoDB as the backend. Solve the same above problems by getting data using MongoDB queries.

**NavTree Project in Jquery**

	Repository name: navtree-(name) Example navtree-john


	Build a hierarchical, navigable tree structure using jQuery. The tree structure should be at least 3 levels deep.

	For example:

	Depth 0

	-- Depth 1

	-- Depth 2

	It should expand and minimize to reveal and hide nested nodes. Do not use an existing library to build the tree structure.

	Please use the IPL dataset that you had previously used for the Visualisation assignment. An example hierarchy could be

	Year > Team > Players

	When the last entity is selected, show a stat relevant to that identity on the page. This can either be a visualisation or a table.
